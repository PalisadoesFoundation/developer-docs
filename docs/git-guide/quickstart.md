This quick start guide is designed for those experienced with Git and Github to quickly begin contributing to Talawa repositories. Please follow the details below:

1. We use **GitHub for our source control and code review processes** to ensure efficient collaboration and seamless management of code changes. To contribute, fork [PalisadoesFoundation/talawa](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa) (or the appropriate [repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation)) to your account and then create feature/issue branches. we currently work on the **develop** branch for all the repositories.
1. We use [merge](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merging)-oriented workflow. you should use `git pull upstream` followed by ` git push origin develop`. To prevent your Pull requests from turning stale compared to the repository, rebase your feature branch before submitting a Pull request. If you want to read more about how to rebase a pull request, you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request).
1. We have tools that help you submit quality code. These include linters, tests and continuous integrations, code coverage percentage, etc.
1. Our projects are maintained by a small group of volunteers with limited resources. Please read these files in each repo to guide your participation.
