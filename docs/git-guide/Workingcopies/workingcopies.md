# Working copies

When you work on Talawa code, there are three copies of the Talawa Git repository that you are generally concerned with:

* The ```upstream``` remote. This is the [official Talawa repository](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa). You probably don’t have write access to this repository.
* The origin remote: Your personal remote repository on GitHub. You’ll use this to share your code and create pull requests.
* Local copy: This lives on your laptop or your remote dev instance, and is what you’ll use to make changes and create commits.

When you work on Talawa code, you will end up moving code between the various working copies.
