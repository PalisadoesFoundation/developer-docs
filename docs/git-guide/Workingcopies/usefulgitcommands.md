# Useful Git commands 

The following commands are useful for moving commits between working copies:

* ```git fetch```: This grabs code from another repository to your local copy. (Defaults to fetching from your default remote, ```origin``` ).
* ```git fetch upstream ```: This grabs code from the upstream repository to your local copy.
* ```git push```: This pushes code from your Local repository to one of the remotes.
* ```git remote```: This helps you configure short names for remotes.
* ```git pull```: This pulls code from our repository. You can read further on [keep your fork updated](/docs/git-guide/Git%20working/Fork.md)
