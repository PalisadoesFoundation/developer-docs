The [Palisadoes Foundation’s](https://www.palisadoes.org) open-source software projects started in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.

Over the years the scope of our work has expanded. Our volunteers now live in all timezones of the globe and work on projects with a truly international scope.

A significant proportion of our original open source contributions came from university students studying software engineering. Participants often came from under-served communities or geographic areas and were sponsored through the various programs in which we participated.

## Sponsors

We appreciate the work of our sponsors over the years.
