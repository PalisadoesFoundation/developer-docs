The [Palisadoes Foundation’s](https://www.palisadoes.org) open-source software projects started in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.

A significant proportion of our original open source contributions came from university students studying software engineering. Participants often came from under-served communities or geographic areas and were sponsored through the various programs in which we participated.

We have participated in the following international programs:

1. Our annual Calico Challenge for Jamaican students
1. The Google Summer of Code
1. Outreachy
1. The Microsoft (India) GitHub Externship

Our most active projects include:

1. **Talawa:** A suite of applications tha help community based organizations manage their memberships. There are many social media, event planning, and fundraising features.
