The [Palisadoes Foundation’s](https://www.palisadoes.org) open-source software projects started in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.

Over the years the scope of our work has expanded. Our volunteers now live in all timezones of the globe and work on projects with a truly international scope.

A significant proportion of our original open source contributions came from university students studying software engineering. Participants often came from under-served communities or geographic areas and were sponsored through the various programs in which we participated.

## Getting Started

Here is a quick guide on getting started with our projects.

1. Watch our YouTube Channel playlist: [Getting Started - Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBUoHxEeyg&list=PLv50qHwThlJUIzscg9a80a9-HmAlmUdCF&pp=gAQB). It covers important topics such as:
   1. Our community culture
   2. How to create issues
   3. How to get issues assigned to you
   4. Our pull request process
   5. The importance of testing
2. Get familiar with the [important files in each repository](#important-files). They cover details that are excluded in our summary YouTube videos.
3. If you are new to GitHub and collaborative coding then [read our GitHub Quick-Start Guide](../git-guide/introduction/quickstart.md).
4. Research the [GitHub unassigned issue trackers for all the projects](../introduction/projects.md)
5. Introduce yourself on our `#general` slack channel. You can join our Slack Channel using the link on the [Palisadoes Foundation GitHub Home Page](http://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation).
6. If you do not see any interesting projects from the proposed ideas or issues, we encourage you to contact the Palisadoes Foundation’s mailing list and propose a new idea. The Palisadoes Foundation does not encourage and will not respond to your personal new open source project ideas which are unrelated to any Palisadoes projects.
7. You can subscribe to our list at [https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes](https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes).
