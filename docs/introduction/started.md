Here is a quick guide on getting started with our projects.

1. Watch our YouTube Channel playlist: [Getting Started - Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBUoHxEeyg&list=PLv50qHwThlJUIzscg9a80a9-HmAlmUdCF&pp=gAQB). It covers important topics such as:
    1. Our community culture
    2. How to create issues
    3. How to get issues assigned to you
    4. Our pull request process
    5. The importance of testing
2. If you are new to GitHub and collaborative coding then [read our GitHub Quick-Start Guide](../git-guide/quickstart).
3. Research the [GitHub issue trackers for all the projects](../introduction/projects) 
4. Introduce yourself on our `#general` slack channel. You can join our Slack Channel using the link on the [Palisadoes Foundation GitHub Home Page](http://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation).
5.  If you do not see any interesting projects from the proposed ideas or issues, we encourage you to contact the Palisadoes Foundationâ€™s mailing list and propose a new idea. The Palisadoes Foundation does not encourage and will not respond to your personal new open source project ideas which are unrelated to any Palisadoes projects.
6.  You can subscribe to our list at [https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes](https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes).
