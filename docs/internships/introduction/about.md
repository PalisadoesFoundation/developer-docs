We are actively seeking additional sources.

## Internship Proposal Ideas

Most of our internships are based on making proposals to improve the source code of our projects. These pages list our latest proposal ideas for the various programs in which we participate:

1. [GSoC Ideas](../gsoc/ideas.md): All you need to know about our multi-year involvement with the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
1. [Calico Challenge Ideas](../calico/ideas.md): Calico shares the same idea list as GSoC.
1. [GSoD Ideas](../gsod/ideas-2024.md): High quality documentation is necessary for all our various participants from user, to developers and more. These ideas help to make our software more usable.

Show us your best!
