Welcome to our internship FAQ page, our guide for success!

## Proposals

:::note Application Format

Your application **must** follow our [application template](../introduction/application-template.md).
:::

- **Q**: What will most help my odds of acceptance?

    - **A**: There are a number of things you can do to help your odds

        1. [A quality proposal](../introduction/application-template.md) - a well thought out proposal that shows you understand what you want to do and have reasonable expectations about what can be accomplished in the time you will have available.
        1. Show evidence of past experience or achievements related to the proposal.
        1. Make a useful patch for the code base - this shows that you can successfully read, edit, and compile our code.
        1. Discuss your application with us and get some feedback. You can chat with us on slack and post a link to your proposal.

- **Q**: What acceptance criteria are used?

    - **A**: These are the most important considerations
        1. Contributors must abide by our code of conduct guidelines at all times. This can be found in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/developer-docs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in each repository.
        1. We want you to be successful in creating transformative projects. Your pull requests must be able to prove your abilities to do so. We **do not count** the number of pull requests in our evaluations. Excessive numbers of commits, abandoned and prematurely closed pull requests indicate struggles in mastering the code base.
        1. Think of all the stakeholders. End users, administrators, and the DevOps teams that will use the application. If any of these groups don’t find it useful and usable, then it won’t be installed, evaluated and implemented. Many technically excellent proposals have been surpassed by ones that consider making all the stakeholders happy. We highly value proposals that consider:
            - Practicability,
            - Performance,
            - Ease of long term support. (eg. Packages that are actively managed and backed by a corporation versus ones created by a single person; proven versus leading edge approaches.)
            - Usability,
            - Perceived stakeholder value,
            - Intuitive UI/UX. (This is often underappreciated)
            
            Our ideas list gives an outline of what we'd like to see implemented, but do not limit your proposal to this bare minimum. Copying feature functionality from other sources without improving upon them is insufficient, our code must always be better. Expand on the possibilities to meet our innovation requirements. We greatly value innovative features and approaches.
        1. Positive mentor interactions.

- **Q**: How do you maintain evaluation impartiality?

    - **A**: We review proposals using our [Conflict of Interest](../introduction/conflicts-of-interest) policy.

:::info GSoC

    In the past we published the number of GSoC slots requested, slots received and the ranking of proposals. This created a lot of over-analysis and misunderstandings which was unhealthy. We now have a policy of not providing this information for any internship program.

    Each year, we may approach unsuccessful candidates to become formal contributors to the Palisadoes Foundation's GitHub account. This small group will have a wide range of experiences and abilities. In many cases we will be taking a chance. We hope this will encourage you to remain active, improve, add features and be more prepared for your careers and subsequent internship programs either with us or other organizations. This is not a guarantee for selection in our future programs.

## Contributions

- **Q**: I want to get involved before submitting my application. Can you guide me?

    - **A**: Getting involved early and showing presence is a good idea and increases your chances for acceptance. 
        1. On the other hand, contributors have to show that they can take steps by themselves, without much "handholding". 
        Mentors will try to help contributors make it successfully through the project; their job is not to give guidance on every step of the way. Of course, the usual communication channels are available to contributors for when they need help on specific topics. Together with our developer introduction guides, contributors should be able to get started.

            So take some initiative yourself. Show that you are capable of working on your own (to a good degree), that you can figure simple things out yourself and that you know when and where to ask questions.

        1. Research the [GitHub issue trackers for all the projects](../../introduction/projects)
        2. Introduce yourself on our `#general` slack channel. You can join our Slack Channel using the link on the [Palisadoes Foundation GitHub Home Page](http://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation).
        3. You can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/palisadoes).

- **Q**: What tutorials can I use to prepare for my first contributions?

    - **A**: We have a lot of videos on our YouTube channel. Our "[Getting Started - Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBUoHxEeyg&list=PLv50qHwThlJUIzscg9a80a9-HmAlmUdCF)" playlist will help you understand our processes better.

:::info

It's very important that you watch all the short videos in our "[Getting Started - Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpBUoHxEeyg&list=PLv50qHwThlJUIzscg9a80a9-HmAlmUdCF)" playlist. They explain our community values, coding principles and ways to avoid the most common mistakes.

## Our Code Base

- **Q**: Is there some place that tells me the process of using the project's code?

    - **A**: Visit our [project pages](../../introduction/projects.md) for complete documentation.

- **Q**: Where can I learn more about a project's code base?

    - **A**: There is quite a bit of good documentation [here](../../introduction/projects.md).

- **Q**: The code base is huge! Where do I start?

    - **A**: Have a look at the directory structure. Each code file documents its purpose each class, function and method is similarly documented. 

- **Q**: I want to get involved before submitting my application. Can you guide me?

    - **A**: Getting involved early and showing presence is a good idea and increases your chances for acceptance. On the other hand, contributors have to show that they can take steps by themselves, without much "handholding".

        So take some initiative yourself. Show that you are capable of working on your own (to a good degree), that you can figure simple things out yourself and that you know when and where to ask questions.

## Mentor Contact

- **Q**: How can I contact internship mentors?

    - **A**: There are many options:

        1. Get in contact with them via our slack channel.
        1. Send an email to:

            ![img](/img/markdown/internships/mentors.png)

- **Q**: How can I feedback on my internship proposal?

    - **A**: Send an email to this address with a link to your proposal in Google Docs:

            ![img](/img/markdown/internships/draft-submissions.png)


:::danger Submit early if you want feedback

Don't expect any feedback on the last week before the deadline, as this is when most applications come in.
