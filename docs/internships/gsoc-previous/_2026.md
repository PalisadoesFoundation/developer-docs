### Talawa: Emergency Management

1. **Description:** After Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica, The Palisadoes Foundation was approached to use Talawa to be used in disaster relief efforts. Additional features were required to make it usable. We want to ensure that the app is usable for such situations anywhere in the world by the end of 2026. Talawa was designed to manage the membership of community based organizations. These organizations are often on the forefront of community projects and disaster recovery efforts. We feel that simple project reporting features would be a very useful addition for such organizations in both the web and mobile applications.
   1. **Field Reporting:** Talawa currently supports attendance at scheduled events with volunteers. However functionality needs to be added to support non-profit organizations supporting relief efforts or regular community projects.
      1. Types of Reporting: There needs to be a way to report on projects that the organization is working on:
         1. Project type: Normal or Disaster
         2. Limited numbers of images and videos of the viscinity
         3. Audio reports of what is happening, possibly converted to text.
         4. The option of regular text input
         5. GeoTags
         6. The name and contact information of the reporter if available and automatic
         7. Whether the situation has been resolved or not
      2. Offline Functionality: In the case of the mobile app, it must be assumed that Internet connectivity may be poor.
         1. The Field Reporting must be able to operate without access to the API by caching inputted data
         2. When connectivity is restored, the data must be uploaded automatically to the API with a mechanism to prevent the API from being overloaded from floods of data from recently re-connected geographic areas.
   2. **Central Reporting:**: There needs to be a project dashboard
      1. Sortable tabular and geographic map based tagging reports with drill downs
      2. Ways to request follow up action from the Talawa Admin backend
1. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. There needs to be ways to identify possible project duplication so that they can be de-duplicated with the original reporters still being updated.
   2. The solution must assume that the end users have limited literacy skills. The more data points that can be calculated and automated, the better.
   3. All tests must pass and be valid.
   4. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
1. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
1. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
1. **Depends on Project:** None
1. **Project Size:** 350 hours (Large)

### Talawa Notification Enhancements

1. **Description:** Talawa's notifications need to be improved.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current Talawa notification system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
      1. Self hosted notifications as they currently rely on third party integrations.
      2. Identify actions in the app that trigger notifications.
      3. Ensure dynamic content (e.g., {username}, {postTitle}) is included in notifications.
      4. Highlight critical notifications with urgency (e.g., red icons for high-priority alerts).
      5. Provide short, actionable notification content with clear links.
      6. Design a scalable architecture to support notifications across mobile and web platforms.
      7. Provide options for users to Mark as Read, Clear Notifications (individual/all), and View History.
      8. Work with the admin interface to define and update notification templates as needed.
1. **Other Features:** We know you can think of other chat related features that would be useful. Please add them to your proposal.
1. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:

### Talawa Typescript Repos: Improve Testing Code Health

1. **Description:** The Talawa Typescript repo testing regimes need to be refactored to improve their effectiveness. The sub-projects below outline the requirements.
   1. **5X Test Speed Improvement**: Our typescript testing process takes too long. We need to find a way to improve its speed without changing the testing package. We have tried various packages in the past with only nominal improvements.
      1. **Sharding:**: Evaluate running tests in parallel to achieve this goal.
         1. Consider using:
            1. Dynamically generated random test values.
            2. Using tests that uniquely initialize themselves and clean up after execution.
               1. Specifically for Talawa-Admin the following best practices applied:
                  1. Prevent DOM pollution and memory leaks
                  2. Isolate the Apollo client caching per test
         2. This may require a phased approach with existing files gradually migrated to the new methodology.
   2. **Improved Linting**: Our linting rules may need to be improved to meet current best practices.
   2. **Configuration Refactoring**: We have many typescript related configuration files stored in the root directory of the repos. We'd like to migrate them under the `config/` directories wherever possible.
   2. **Test Refactoring**: We recognize that some of the tests may be ineffieciently designed.
      1. **Best Practices:** Refactor the entire code base to meet the best practices suggested by CodeRabbit.ai
      2. **Performance:** Evaulate ways to individually improve test performance.
      3. **End to End:**
         1. Extend E2E coverage for the User Portal
         2. [Consider E2E tests using puppeteer and jest](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/pull/580#issuecomment-1463387821)
      4. **Better Memory Management:** Use keploy / tramline to improve the memory management of the application as it is currently too bloated
      5. **AI:** Use AI to do unit testing for the Talawa application
1. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. Accurate test code coverage calculations in both your local repository and our CodeCov third party service.
   3. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
1. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
1. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.

### Talawa Admin: Code Refactoring

1. **Description:** The Talawa-Admin code base needs to be completely refactored to make it maintainable in the long term.
   1. **Directory Structure:** To be more developer friendly, the directory structure needs to be more clearly defined into non-overlapping areas:
      1. Admin Portal specific folders and files
      2. User Portal specific folders and files
      3. Shared component folders and files
   2. **Best Practices:** The updated code needs to comply with these best practices:
      1. Leverage generics for type flexibility without over-generalization. This includes:
         1. Generic components
         2. Descriptive generic names
         3. The application of suitable constraints to generics
      2. Promote type safety and clarity
         1. Define prop types clearly
         2. Consistent naming conventions that are documented and enforced
      3. Design for reusability
         1. Isolate logic
         2. Use props for customization
         3. Centralize shared logic
      4. Enhance maintainability
         1. Document components
         2. Modular CSS styling
   3. **Functionality:** You will also need to validate your work and those before you.
      1. Features: All existing screens must function as expected and have appropriate tests.
      2. UI/UX: Screens must be 100% compliant with the official figma design guide:
         1. https://docs.talawa.io/docs/design/ux-design-system#talawa-admin---figma-designs
2. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin

### Talawa Third Party Authentication

1. **Description:** The Talawa apps currently require logins based on credentials stored in the database. This adds an additional registration step. The use of third party authentication applications would make this easier.
   1. **RBAC:** We want Role Based Access Control to include authentication via where the API operator, not The Palisadoes Foundation is responsible for the management. This includes:
      1. OAuth
         1. Gmail
         2. GitHub
         3. Meta
         4. Other well known authentication systems
      2. LDAP
      3. Active Directory
   2. **Registration:** Initial user registration must offer these options, in addition to a username/password option stored in the API's database.
2. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
