### Talawa Communication Enhancements

1. **Description:** Talawa's communication functionality needs to be expanded for both the mobile and web applications.
   1. **Enhanced Features:**
      1. **Chat** The current chat feature lacks expected features. We require the following functionalities which need to be added:
         1. Search
         2. Delete chat message
         3. Pinning chat messages
         4. Leave group chats
         5. Allow users to share multiple images & videos
         6. Send voice messages
         7. React to messages
         8. Implement encryption
         9. Report & block users/messages
         10. Purge older chat messages
      1. **Notifications:** The current Talawa notification system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
         1. Self hosted notifications as they currently rely on third party integrations.
         2. Identify actions in the app that trigger notifications.
         3. Ensure dynamic content (e.g., {username}, {postTitle}) is included in notifications.
         4. Highlight critical notifications with urgency (e.g., red icons for high-priority alerts).
         5. Provide short, actionable notification content with clear links.
         6. Design a scalable architecture to support notifications across mobile and web platforms.
         7. Provide options for users to Mark as Read, Clear Notifications (individual/all), and View History.
         8. Work with the admin interface to define and update notification templates as needed.
2. **Other Features:** We know you can think of other chat related features that would be useful. Please add them to your proposal.
3. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
4. **Repos to update:** Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin, Talawa
5. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
6. **Depends on Project:** None
7. **Project Size:** 350 hours (Large)
8. **Possible Mentors:** Meetul Rahore
9. **Difficulty:** Hard
10. **Impact Definition:** "Core development"

## Universal QR Attendance & Check-In System

1. **Description** Develop a secure, mobile-first check-in system. Administrators will generate event-specific QR codes via the web portal, and members will use the Talawa mobile app to "scan in," automatically updating the organization's attendance database.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current Talawa events management system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
      1. **Gap Analysis:** Currently, Talawa lacks an automated way to track event attendance. Admins must manually verify members, which is inefficient for large gatherings or recurring meetings.
      2. **User Persona:**
         1. Administrators and Members managing events.
         2. Members attending them.
      3. **The Impact:** This feature transforms the event experience by allowing "frictionless entry." It provides administrators with instant, accurate data on community engagement levels while giving members a modern, digital "ticket" experience within their app.
   2. **Other Features:** We know you can think of other chat related features that would be useful. Please add them to your proposal.
2. **Technical Tasks:**
   1. **Repository Tasks:** These general tasks will be required:
      1. **Backend:** Create a check-in validation service and secure token generation (JWT) in `talawa-api`.
      2. **Mobile:** Implement a QR scanner view using native device capabilities and a "My Passes" section in the user profile.
      3. **Web:** Build a real-time attendance monitor and QR generator in the `talawa-admin` event dashboard.
   2. **Key Dependencies:** Mobile Camera Permissions; API Event Schema extension; Secure Token Logic.
3. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
4. **Repos to update:** Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin, Talawa
5. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
6. **Depends on Project:** None
7. **Project Size:** 175 Hours (Medium)
8. **Possible Mentors:** Dominic Mills
9. **Difficulty:** Medium
10. **Impact Definition:** "Core development"

## Shared Resource & Facility Booking

1. **Description** Design a centralized booking system where administrators list "Resources" (facilities or equipment). Members can then check availability via a calendar and request a time slot.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current Talawa events management system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
      1. **Gap Analysis:** Many communities share physical assets (vans, projectors, clubrooms). Talawa lacks a scheduling layer to manage these, leading to scheduling conflicts and underutilized resources.
      2. **User Persona:** **Members** requesting resources and Admins overseeing assets.
      3. **The Impact:** This maximizes the "sharing economy" within a community. It makes shared assets more accessible and organized, reducing the need for external spreadsheets or paper sign-up sheets.
      4. **Technical Tasks:**
      5. **Logic:** Build a calendar-based availability engine in the API using PostgreSQL date/time functions to prevent double-booking.
      6. **Mobile:** Create a "Resource Catalog" where members can view details and submit booking requests.
      7. **Admin:** Develop an approval workflow in the admin portal for resource managers.
   1. **Repository Tasks:** These general tasks will be required:
      1. **Key Dependencies:** Time-slot conflict resolution logic; Calendar UI components (Mobile & Web).
2. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin, Talawa
4. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
5. **Depends on Project:** None
6. **Project Size:** 175 Hours (Medium)
7. **Possible Mentors:** TBD
8. **Difficulty:** Medium
9. **Impact Definition:** "Core development"

## Custom

Custom ideas add to the existing repos in ways we would not have foreseen. They must:

1. Use existing Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories
2. Add complementary features to one or more existing Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories

Custom ideas are not for new Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories.

:::note

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

If you plan to use AI in your Custom proposal, we prefer the use of free open source models, preferably small enough to run on a small non-GPU server.

:::

### Custom (Small)

**Note:** It's important that you append a brief 3-4 word description to the name of your Custom idea. This will make it uniquely identifiable. It could assist us in selecting one or more Custom ideas. For example if your Custom idea is to `improve the deployment of foo`, you could name your project `Custom (Small) - Foo Bar`. The title must have the string `Custom (Small)` in it.

1. **Description:** Do the ideas need something more? What completely new thoughts could be applied to the existing ideas? If you have answers to these questions then this section is for you.
2. **Expected Outcomes:** Your proposal must meet the guidelines below. It must:
   1. Not depend on other participants. There should be minimal impact by other participants disappearing or doing a very bad or very good job.
   1. Add completely new features not previously stated in ideas.
   1. Create features that users will want or facilitate new features that will be the groundwork for features that they would want.
   1. Be suitable for use by most non-profit organization.
      1. We are not interested in membership subscriptions and any related financial management at this time.
