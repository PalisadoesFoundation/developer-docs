### Talawa Notification Enhancements

1. **Description:** Talawa's notifications need to be improved.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current Talawa notification system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
      1. Self hosted notifications as they currently rely on third party integrations.
      2. Identify actions in the app that trigger notifications.
      3. Ensure dynamic content (e.g., {username}, {postTitle}) is included in notifications.
      4. Highlight critical notifications with urgency (e.g., red icons for high-priority alerts).
      5. Provide short, actionable notification content with clear links.
      6. Design a scalable architecture to support notifications across mobile and web platforms.
      7. Provide options for users to Mark as Read, Clear Notifications (individual/all), and View History.
      8. Work with the admin interface to define and update notification templates as needed.

### Talawa Typescript Repos: Improve Testing Code Health

1. **Description:** The Talawa Typescript repo testing regimes need to be refactored to improve their effectiveness. The sub-projects below outline the requirements.
   1. **5X Test Speed Improvement**: Our typescript testing process takes too long. We need to find a way to improve its speed without changing the testing package. We have tried various packages in the past with only nominal improvements.
      1. **Sharding:**: Evaluate running tests in parallel to achieve this goal.
         1. Consider using:
            1. Dynamically generated random test values.
            2. Using tests that uniquely initialize themselves and clean up after execution.
               1. Specifically for Talawa-Admin the following best practices applied:
                  1. Prevent DOM pollution and memory leaks
                  2. Isolate the Apollo client caching per test
         2. This may require a phased approach with existing files gradually migrated to the new methodology.
   2. **Improved Linting**: Our linting rules may need to be improved to meet current best practices.
   2. **Configuration Refactoring**: We have many typescript related configuration files stored in the root directory of the repos. We'd like to migrate them under the `config/` directories wherever possible.
   2. **Test Refactoring**: We recognize that some of the tests may be ineffieciently designed.
      1. **Best Practices:** Refactor the entire code base to meet the best practices suggested by CodeRabbit.ai
      2. **Performance:** Evaulate ways to individually improve test performance.
      3. **End to End:**
         1. Extend E2E coverage for the User Portal
         2. [Consider E2E tests using puppeteer and jest](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/pull/580#issuecomment-1463387821)
      4. **Better Memory Management:** Use keploy / tramline to improve the memory management of the application as it is currently too bloated
      5. **AI:** Use AI to do unit testing for the Talawa application
1. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. Accurate test code coverage calculations in both your local repository and our CodeCov third party service.
   3. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
1. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
1. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.

### Talawa Admin: Code Refactoring

1. **Description:** The Talawa-Admin code base needs to be completely refactored to make it maintainable in the long term.
   1. **Directory Structure:** To be more developer friendly, the directory structure needs to be more clearly defined into non-overlapping areas:
      1. Admin Portal specific folders and files
      2. User Portal specific folders and files
      3. Shared component folders and files
   2. **Best Practices:** The updated code needs to comply with these best practices:
      1. Leverage generics for type flexibility without over-generalization. This includes:
         1. Generic components
         2. Descriptive generic names
         3. The application of suitable constraints to generics
      2. Promote type safety and clarity
         1. Define prop types clearly
         2. Consistent naming conventions that are documented and enforced
      3. Design for reusability
         1. Isolate logic
         2. Use props for customization
         3. Centralize shared logic
      4. Enhance maintainability
         1. Document components
         2. Modular CSS styling with a global sheet for other aspects.
   3. **Functionality:** You will also need to validate your work and those before you.
      1. Features: All existing screens must function as expected and have appropriate tests.
      2. UI/UX: Screens must be 100% compliant with the official figma design guide:
         1. https://docs.talawa.io/docs/design/ux-design-system#talawa-admin---figma-designs
2. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
4. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.

### Talawa Third Party Authentication

1. **Description:** The Talawa apps currently require logins based on credentials stored in the database. This adds an additional registration step. The use of third party authentication applications would make this easier.
   1. **RBAC:** We want Role Based Access Control to include authentication via where the API operator, not The Palisadoes Foundation is responsible for the management. This includes:
      1. OAuth
         1. Gmail
         2. GitHub
         3. Meta
         4. Other well known authentication systems
      2. LDAP
      3. Active Directory
   2. **Registration:** Initial user registration must offer these options, in addition to a username/password option stored in the API's database.
2. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa-Plugin, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
4. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
5. **Depends on Project:** None
6. **Project Size:** 350 hours (Large)
7. **Possible Mentors:** TBD
8. **Difficulty:** Medium
