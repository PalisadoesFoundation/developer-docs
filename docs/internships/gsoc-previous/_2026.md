### Talawa Chat Enhancements

1. **Description:** Talawa's chat functionality needs to be expanded for both the mobile and web applications.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current chat feature lacks expected features. We require the following functionalities which need to be added:
      1. Search
      2. Delete chat message
      3. Pinning chat messages
      4. Leave group chats
      5. Allow users to share multiple images & videos
      6. Send voice messages
      7. React to messages
      8. Implement encryption
      9. Report & block users/messages
      10. Purge older chat messages
1. **Other Features:** We know you can think of other chat related features that would be useful. Please add them to your proposal.
1. **Expected Outcomes:** In addition to the outcomes described above, the following must also apply:
   1. All tests must pass and be valid.
   2. The overall test code coverage of the repo and individual code files must in all cases be greater than 95%.

### Talawa Notification Enhancements

1. **Description:** Talawa's notifications need to be improved.
   1. **Enhanced Features:** The current Talawa notification system needs to be enhanced with the following functionalities:
      1. Self hosted notifications as they currently rely on third party integrations.
      2. Identify actions in the app that trigger notifications.
      3. Ensure dynamic content (e.g., {username}, {postTitle}) is included in notifications.
      4. Highlight critical notifications with urgency (e.g., red icons for high-priority alerts).
      5. Provide short, actionable notification content with clear links.
      6. Design a scalable architecture to support notifications across mobile and web platforms.
      7. Provide options for users to Mark as Read, Clear Notifications (individual/all), and View History.
      8. Work with the admin interface to define and update notification templates as needed.
1. **Other Features:** We know you can think of other chat related features that would be useful. Please add them to your proposal.

## Universal QR Attendance & Check-In System

- **Project Description:** Develop a secure, mobile-first check-in system. Administrators will generate event-specific QR codes via the web portal, and members will use the Talawa mobile app to "scan in," automatically updating the organization's attendance database.
- **Gap Analysis:** Currently, Talawa lacks an automated way to track event attendance. Admins must manually verify members, which is inefficient for large gatherings or recurring meetings.
- **User Persona:** **Administrators** managing events and **Members** attending them.
- **The Impact:** This feature transforms the event experience by allowing "frictionless entry." It provides administrators with instant, accurate data on community engagement levels while giving members a modern, digital "ticket" experience within their app.
- **Technical Tasks:**
- **Backend:** Create a check-in validation service and secure token generation (JWT) in `talawa-api`.
- **Mobile:** Implement a QR scanner view using native device capabilities and a "My Passes" section in the user profile.
- **Web:** Build a real-time attendance monitor and QR generator in the `talawa-admin` event dashboard.

- **Key Dependencies:** Mobile Camera Permissions; API Event Schema extension; Secure Token Logic.
- **Possible Mentors:** Dominic Mills
- **Project Length:** ~175 Hours | **Complexity:** Medium | **Repositories:** `talawa-api`, `talawa` (Mobile), `talawa-admin`

## Modular Donation & Dues Hub

- **Project Description:** Build a robust financial engine that supports both one-time donations and recurring membership dues. This project focuses on a modular approach, ensuring the core remains "light" while using the plugin system for payment processing.
- **Gap Analysis:** Talawa's roots in community based organization management lacked a generalized, secular financial module. There is currently no way for a club to collect membership dues or a charity to run a specific fundraising campaign.
- **User Persona:** **Treasurers/Admins** and **Supporting Members**.
- **The Impact:** By centralizing finances, organizations can maintain transparency and sustainability. Members can support their community directly through their mobile devices, increasing the likelihood of contributions through convenience.
- **Technical Tasks:**
- **Integration:** Implement a secure payment gateway (Stripe/Others) via the `talawa-plugin` architecture.
- **Database:** Design **PostgreSQL** schemas for tracking transaction history, gift aid (where applicable), and recurring payment tokens.
- **UX:** Create a "Give/Pay Dues" interface in the mobile app with status tracking.

- **Key Dependencies:** PCI-compliant gateway (Stripe/Others); Secure environment variable management; Webhooks for real-time confirmation.
- **Project Length:** ~350 Hours | **Complexity:** High | **Repositories:** `talawa-api`, `talawa-plugin`, `talawa` (Mobile)

## Shared Resource & Facility Booking

- **Project Description:** Design a centralized booking system where administrators list "Resources" (facilities or equipment). Members can then check availability via a calendar and request a time slot.
- **Gap Analysis:** Many communities share physical assets (vans, projectors, clubrooms). Talawa lacks a scheduling layer to manage these, leading to scheduling conflicts and underutilized resources.
- **User Persona:** **Members** requesting resources and **Admins** overseeing assets.
- **The Impact:** This maximizes the "sharing economy" within a community. It makes shared assets more accessible and organized, reducing the need for external spreadsheets or paper sign-up sheets.
- **Technical Tasks:**
- **Logic:** Build a calendar-based availability engine in the API using **PostgreSQL** date/time functions to prevent double-booking.
- **Mobile:** Create a "Resource Catalog" where members can view details and submit booking requests.
- **Admin:** Develop an approval workflow in the admin portal for resource managers.

- **Key Dependencies:** Time-slot conflict resolution logic; Calendar UI components (Mobile & Web).
- **Project Length:** ~175 Hours | **Complexity:** Medium | **Repositories:** `talawa-api`, `talawa` (Mobile), `talawa-admin`

## Custom

Custom ideas add to the existing repos in ways we would not have foreseen. They must:

1. Use existing Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories
2. Add complementary features to one or more existing Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories

Custom ideas are not for new Palisadoes Foundation Talawa\* code repositories.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

If you plan to use AI in your Custom proposal, we prefer the use of open source models

### Custom (Small)

**Note:** It's important that you append a brief 3-4 word description to the name of your Custom idea. This will make it uniquely identifiable. It could assist us in selecting one or more Custom ideas. For example if your Custom idea is to `improve the deployment of foo`, you could name your project `Custom (Small) - Foo Bar`. The title must have the string `Custom (Small)` in it.

1. **Description:** Do the ideas need something more? What completely new thoughts could be applied to the existing ideas? If you have answers to these questions then this section is for you.
2. **Expected Outcomes:** Your proposal must meet the guidelines below. It must:
   1. Not depend on other participants. There should be minimal impact by other participants disappearing or doing a very bad or very good job.
   1. Add completely new features not previously stated in ideas.
   1. Create features that users will want or facilitate new features that will be the groundwork for features that they would want.
   1. Be suitable for use by most non-profit organization.
      1. We are not interested in membership subscriptions and any related financial management at this time.
   1. Justify 90 hours of work.
3. **Repos to update:** Talawa, Talawa-API, Talawa-Admin
4. **Skills Required:** Code stacks related to repos above. See introduction section.
5. **Depends on Project:** N/A
