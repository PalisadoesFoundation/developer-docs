## About me

I am Abhirami Muraleedharan Santhakumari, a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor. I worked on a project to modernize the SwitchMap-NG web interface, improving usability, performance, and network insights. 

## Project overview

The project was designed and implemented to provide a modern, interactive, and responsive web UI for network monitoring. This included integrating a Next.js/React frontend with the existing Flask backend, creating dynamic network topology visualizations using CDP/LLDP data, and providing historical device movement and bandwidth analysis. The focus was on improving performance, user experience, and maintainability while supporting large datasets efficiently.

**Benefits**

* Enhanced performance and reduced network load through caching, memoization, and lazy loading.
* Improved usability with responsive design, standardized error handling, and smooth interactions for large datasets.
* Added a range of useful tools including interactive charts, graphs, and topology visualizations for better network insights.
* Easier maintenance and scalability through modern frontend architecture and automated documentation generation.

**Deliverables**

* Next.js/React-based UI replacing legacy Flask-table views.
* Interactive network topology visualizations with CDP/LLDP data.
* Historical bandwidth and device movement charts with time-based insights.
* Automated documentation generation and GitHub Actions integration.
* High test coverage ensuring reliable and maintainable code.

- Memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) and pagination/virtualized rendering for large datasets.
- Loading performance: skeletons and Suspense boundaries for faster perceived load.

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS.
- **Theme Support:** Seamless dark/light mode switching.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with auto-dismiss.
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loading and Suspense boundaries.
- **Navigation:** Intuitive sidebar with breadcrumb navigation.

## Current State

The SwitchMap-NG frontend is now fully functional with a modern React/Next.js interface. Core features, including interactive network topology visualization, device analytics, historical charts, configuration management, and theme support, are implemented and stable. The system supports responsive design, and has high test coverage (96.08%). Remaining work mostly involves advanced enhancements, simulations, and optimizations.

---

## What Remains

* **SNMP Simulation Lab:** Setting up an SNMP-based simulated device lab will help new contributors test and develop features without requiring real network hardware.
* **Device Status Reliability:** Currently, devices that fail to respond are omitted from events and never appear as "down" in the frontend. Improving this requires coordinated changes to both frontend and backend logic.
* **Support for Non-SNMP Devices:** Extend monitoring capabilities to include devices managed by other network protocols.
* **Database Optimization:** Implement data aggregation and cleanup mechanisms to manage historical event data more efficiently.
* **Responsive Graph Enhancements:** Minor adjustments are needed to ensure graphs remain fully responsive across all screen sizes.
* **Configuration Management:** Move configuration fields from server-side YAML files to the database for better scalability and security, while maintaining safe password handling.
* **Dynamic Chart Rendering:** Add options for users to choose which charts to render globally or per device/interface, with backend support for dynamic polling based on these preferences.

## Challenges and lessons learned

- **Customizing vis-network:** The network canvas did not respond to theme changes automatically, requiring manual theme handling and color adjustments.
- **Designing an intuitive frontend:** As this was a new frontend, creating prototypes and iterating based on mentor and user feedback was essential before implementation.
- **Complex data querying:** The database structure, where each event stored a snapshot of all devices, made efficient querying and rendering in the frontend challenging.
- Learned to balance performance with usability by deferring heavy chart rendering and using caching.
- Improved skills in integrating modern frontend frameworks (Next.js, React 19, Tailwind 4) with legacy backend systems.
- Gained deeper understanding of GraphQL schema design and efficient data querying.
- Realized the importance of modular architecture, testing, and documentation for long-term maintainability.
- Strengthened debugging and design iteration skills through close mentor feedback and cross-component troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

This project was an invaluable learning experience in frontend architecture, API integration, and open-source collaboration. 

**Acknowledgements:** I am grateful to mentors Aashima Wadhwa, Dominic Mills, and Peter Harrison for their technical guidance, feedback, and code reviews throughout the development process. I would like to thank Abhishek Raj, the backend contributor, for his seamless collaboration.
