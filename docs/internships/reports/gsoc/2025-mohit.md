### About me

Hi there! My name is Mohit Maulekhi, a passionate software developer with expertise in Flutter and mobile app development. I have been actively contributing to open source projects, particularly within the Palisadoes Foundation ecosystem.

My journey with **Talawa** led to my selection as a **GSoC 2025 contributor** for the Palisadoes Foundation, working on mobile app improvements and hardening.
I enjoy building scalable mobile applications, exploring new technologies, and contributing to meaningful open source projects.

### Project overview

My project focused on **Improved Usability & Hardening - Talawa Mobile**, with the goal of enhancing performance, maintainability, and user experience through comprehensive refactoring and feature improvements.

The key objectives were:
- Refactor existing Flutter code to follow **modular and scalable architecture**.
- **Security Enhancements** - Improved authentication flow and secure token handling
- **Recurring Events** - Complete event management system with recurring event capabilities
- **Semiotics for UX Improvements** - Enhanced user experience through animations, visual feedback, and cleaner UI patterns
- **Code Improvement and Enhancements** - Refactored existing Flutter code to follow modular and scalable architecture


**Technologies used**: Flutter, Dart, GraphQL, REST APIs, State Management, Mobile UI/UX Design.

### Project recap

Throughout GSoC, I:
- **Restructured the app** into feature-based modules for better maintainability and efficiency.
- **Enhanced authentication system** with secure token handling and membership request functionality.
- **Refactored posts and pinned posts** to work with new CRUD operations and improved UI for attachments.
- **Implemented event and recurring events management** with calendar-based screens and proper deletion/update logic.
- **Created fundraising features** including campaigns, pledges, and multi-currency support.
- **Updated API queries and mutations** for improved backend integration.
- **Improved developer experience** with better project structure and documentation.
