### About me

- Hi there! My name is Syed, currently pursuing my Bachelors from Aligarh Muslim University, India.  
- For the past year, I've been actively contributing to open source, primarily within the Palisadoes Foundation.  
- I began my open source journey with **Talawa** in August 2024, which eventually led to my selection as a **GSoC 2025 contributor** for the Palisadoes Foundation.  
- Outside coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring new tools, and participating in community events.

---

### Project overview

My project focused on **enhancing the testing infrastructure across Talawa repositories**, with the goal of improving reliability, maintainability, and automation in testing workflows.  

The key objectives were:
- Implement **End-to-End (E2E)** testing for Talawa Admin (web) and Talawa Mobile.
- Enhance **code quality checks** and introduce pre-commit validations.
- Integrate **automated unit test generation** using Keploy’s PR Agent.
- Establish **continuous security testing** using OWASP ZAP.

**Technologies used**: React, Flutter, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Cypress.io, GitHub Actions, CI/CD.

---

### Project recap

Throughout GSoC, I:
- Introduced **Cypress-based E2E tests** for the Talawa Admin web app.
- Set up **CI/CD workflows** for automated E2E runs using GitHub Actions.
- Added **code coverage reporting** and a **POM consistency checker** for test quality.
- Implemented **Integration Testing** for Talawa Mobile using Flutter’s Integration Test package and the Robot Pattern.
- Integrated **Keploy’s PR Agent** to suggest test cases automatically.
- Added **OWASP ZAP scans** for automated security testing.

### Current state

- **Talawa Admin:** ~60% E2E test coverage  
- **Talawa Mobile:** ~40% integration test coverage  
- Automated workflows for E2E tests within CI/CD.
- ZAP security scan into CI/CD workflow.
- Security scans and code coverage reports run automatically on every PR.

---

### What remains

- Extend E2E coverage for **User Portal** (Events, Posts, Plugins).  
- Add **Integration Tests** for Events and Chat in the mobile app.  
- Further refine the **security and performance testing pipelines**.  

Tracking these follow-up issues in:
- [Talawa Admin GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues)
- [Talawa Mobile GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues)

### Challenges and lessons learned

- Balancing test reliability with CI runtime optimization was challenging but rewarding.  
- Gained more control with version control systems and collaborative workflows on GitHub.
- Learned to structure tests using **Page Object Model** and **Robot Pattern**, ensuring cleaner, scalable test architecture.  
- Gained deep insights into **GitHub Actions**, **CI/CD automation**, and **security testing** integration.  
- Writing documentation emphasized the importance of clarity for future contributors.

### Conclusion

This project significantly strengthened Talawa’s testing infrastructure, automating quality checks and improving overall reliability.

Special thanks to my mentors **[Kevonia Tomlinson](https://github.com/kevoniat)**, **[Tasneem Koushar](https://github.com/tasneemkoushar)**, and **[Md Noman Khan](https://github.com/noman2002)** for their invaluable guidance, feedback, and support throughout this journey.  

I also extend my gratitude to the **Palisadoes Foundation** community for creating such a collaborative environment.  
I look forward to continuing my contributions and helping maintain these improvements beyond GSoC.
