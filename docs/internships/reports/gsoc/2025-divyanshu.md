### About me

Hi, I’m **Divyanshu Gautam**, a **software developer**, and a **final-year B.Tech Computer Science student**. I’m passionate about building scalable, impactful software solutions and exploring the latest technologies in backend and frontend development.  

I began contributing to **The Palisadoes Foundation** in **2024**, marking the start of my **open-source journey**. Although I wasn’t selected for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** that year, I continued my journey as an **intern** at Palisadoes, which significantly strengthened my technical foundation. In **2025**, I applied again and was successfully **selected as a GSoC contributor**.

---

### Project overview

My project focused on **enhancing the Talawa platform’s event management system** by adding full support for **recurring events**, **event action items**, and **volunteer coordination**. The work involved both backend (`talawa-api`) and frontend (`talawa-admin`) improvements, introducing advanced features to simplify event scheduling, improve community engagement, and support complex recurring patterns.  

Technically, the project required:
- Designing new **database schemas** for recurring events and associated entities (using Drizzle ORM).  
- Implementing **background workers** and **cron jobs** for automatic event generation and cleanup.  
- Updating **GraphQL mutations** and resolvers for flexible CRUD operations.  
- Building **frontend interfaces** to allow users to create, edit, and manage recurring events, volunteers, and action items intuitively.

---

### Project recap

Throughout the summer, I:
- Implemented **recurring event creation, updates, deletions, and instance management**.
- Added **cron-based event generation and cleanup** workflows.
- Integrated **action item management** for both series and individual event instances.
- Developed the **volunteer and volunteer group management system** with per-instance exceptions.
- Contributed both backend and frontend implementations to achieve full feature parity.  

This work collectively elevated the Talawa platform’s event management capabilities to an enterprise-grade standard.

### Current state

By the end of GSoC 2025:
- **Recurring events** are fully functional across backend and frontend.  
- **Volunteer management** supports both series-wide and per-instance configurations.  
- **Action items** can be inherited, overridden, or defined per instance.  
- **Background jobs** ensure automatic generation and cleanup of event instances.  
- All related **GraphQL resolvers, mutations, and UI workflows** have been tested and merged.  

Talawa’s event module is now stable, feature-rich, and ready for production deployment.

---

### What remains

Future work may include:


- Further optimizing **cron job performance**.  
- Fixing and refining **issues related to event tags, venue management, and certain design aspects** of the events interface.  

These remaining improvements will be opened as **new contribution opportunities** for other community members to continue enhancing Talawa’s event system.

---

### Challenges and lessons learned

Some challenges included:
- Designing a **robust data model** for recurring events that supported editing, splitting, and deletion without data loss.  
- Managing **instance synchronization** when templates changed (e.g., “this and following” updates).  
- Balancing backend efficiency with frontend usability for complex recurrence logic.  

Key lessons learned:
- **Open-source collaboration** requires clear communication and detailed PR documentation.  
- Incremental development and frequent testing are crucial for large architectural changes.  
- Working with real-world production systems taught me the importance of **backward compatibility** and **data consistency**.

### Conclusion

This GSoC journey was incredibly rewarding — it not only strengthened my technical and problem-solving skills but also deepened my understanding of large-scale open-source collaboration.  

I’d like to thank my mentors and contributors from **The Palisadoes Foundation** for their constant support and guidance. Their feedback helped me grow as both a developer and a collaborator.  

I’m proud to have contributed to Talawa’s evolution and look forward to continuing my open-source journey beyond GSoC.
