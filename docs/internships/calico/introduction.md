[The Palisadoes Foundation](https://www.palisadoes.org) is sponsoring the Calico Challenge. This page is your entry point to the program.

The Calico Challenge is a Palisadoes program that offers stipends to student developers to write software code for various open source software projects. It allows students to publicly show the quality of their work.

It is open to Jamaican students residing in Jamaica for the duration of the exercise.

Our projects are advanced. A majority of participants are enrolled in university or college Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs.

By participating in our community and code base you'll get insights into what needs to be done.
