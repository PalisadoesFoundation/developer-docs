## About Palisadoes

The Palisadoes Foundation has been sponsoring work on this open-source project for a number of years. Our most popular project is Talawa, a modular open source project to help community-based organizations such as clubs, neighborhood groups, volunteer associations, non-profits and open source projects manage their daily activities. Most user interaction is via a mobile app.
