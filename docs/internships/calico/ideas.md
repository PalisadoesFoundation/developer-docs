## Introduction

Welcome to our Calico ideas page! 

## Ideas

We don't provide a structured list of ideas for Calico projects.

We welcome novel ideas that will transform the code base by:

1. Adding new features 
1. Refactoring the code to be more resilient or maintainable

By participating in our community and code base you'll get insights into what needs to be done.

## Base Requirements

Your project idea must meet these minimum criteria:

1. Justify 350 hours of work
1. Follow the guidelines in our [internship application template](../introduction/application-template.md)
