[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (GSoC) is a Google program that promotes open source software development by sponsoring contributors to work on open source projects from the comfort of their home. If you are a person interested in developing open source software, this program is for you!

GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

Palisadoes is happy to participate in this initiative since 2022! As a GSoC organization, we look for contributors who are willing to learn, have good coding skills and, most importantly, have a keen interest in our projects and open source software development in general.

## Conditions

To participate as a contributor, you must be at least 18 years old at time of registration and an open source beginner.
