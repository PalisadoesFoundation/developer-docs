[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (GSoC) is a Google program that promotes open source software development by sponsoring contributors to work on open source projects from the comfort of their home. If you are a person interested in developing open source software, this program is for you!

GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

Palisadoes is happy to participate in this initiative since 2022! As a GSoC organization, we look for contributors who are willing to learn, have good coding skills and, most importantly, have a keen interest in our projects and open source software development in general.

## Conditions

To participate as a contributor, you must be at least 18 years old at time of registration and an open source beginner.

:::info Eligibility

Check your eligibility at the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started)
:::

Contributors who successfully complete GSoC will receive financial [compensation](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) for their work.

## First Steps


- Google's [Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student) is the best place to start!

    Read it carefully to get to know the initiative. The guide has a very good overview of the program and precious advice on how to get started, communicate, write your proposal and start the work. See also Google's [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

    Review the [Advice for Students](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html) to make sure you really want to apply to GSoC.

- Get familiar with our projects

    Investigate our history, mission and get involved in the community. Browse the source code to get an idea of the project dimension and how it is organized. Be sure to know the basic usability as an end-user!
    
    Visit our general internship [FAQ](../introduction/faq.md) page.

- Write your project proposal.

    Head over to our GSoC [ideas page](../gsoc/ideas.md) to pick a topic that interests you. You can also take inspiration from projects from previous years.

We also recommend reading Google's [guide for writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

:::note Application Format

Your application **must** follow our [application template](../introduction/application-template.md).

:::danger Submit early if you want feedback

Don't expect any feedback on the last week before the deadline, as this is when most applications come in.

## FAQ

- **Q**: I have so many questions about the process. Where can I get answers?

    - **A**: Visit our general internship [FAQ](../introduction/faq.md) page for all you need to know! We cover:
         1. How to create proposals
         1. How to get familiar with the code base
         1. How to contact mentors

- **Q**: If I have a proposal idea, should I start proposing issues and begin work on it during the contribution period? 
    - **A**: GSoC recommends that you don’t do this. Focus on fixing bugs or issues that may hold up your proposal if it is selected.

- **Q**: I’ve noticed most of Palisadoes’ intern alumni are university students.  Do you have any additional eligibility criteria outside of the GSoC rules? 
    - **A**: We only follow the GSoC rules.

- **Q**: Is it possible to get accepted for two different proposals/GSOC slots?
    - **A**: Please refer to the GSoC rules. 

- **Q**: Can we submit multiple proposals to the Palisadoes Foundation?
    - **A**: Please refer to the GSoC rules. 

- **Q**: I have an idea in mind, and would like to code a small demonstration, can I do that? 
    - **A**: GSoC recommends that you don't start coding your projects beforehand. Focus on creating a clear proposal. 

- **Q**: What do the “GSoC Priority” GitHub issue labels signify?  
    - **A**: The “GSoC Priority” labels are not considered in  the application process. They help us track the  issues that need to be completed before the GSoC work period to maximize the success of our projects. 

- **Q**: Can we create a completely original proposal that’s not in the Ideas List?
    - **A**: Yes. Our Hybrid ideas were created to encourage this. 

:::info General Expectations

    In the past we published the number of GSoC slots requested, slots received and the ranking of proposals. This created a lot of over-analysis and misunderstandings which was unhealthy. We now have a policy of not providing this information for any internship program.

    Each year, we may approach unsuccessful candidates to become formal contributors to the Palisadoes Foundation's GitHub account. This small group will have a wide range of experiences and abilities. In many cases we will be taking a chance. We hope this will encourage you to remain active, improve, add features and be more prepared for your careers and subsequent internship programs either with us or other organizations. This is not a guarantee for selection in our future programs.
