<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to our ideas page! Get familiar with our general philosophy by reading this section. The ideas follow afterwards.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="general-considerations">General Considerations<a href="#general-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to General Considerations" title="Direct link to General Considerations">​</a></h3>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of ideas, but they broadly classify the types of features on which we&#x27;d like to focus our attentions.</p>
<p>You are open to propose your own solutions.</p>
<ol>
<li>We encourage candidates to think laterally.</li>
<li>Take the initiative and consider something hybrid taking thoughts from various ideas posted here or something totally new.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want ideas that will have a material impact on the project</p>
<p>Remember, the ideas list is just a guide for what we feel could be achieved, and not a strict list of requirements. Think of the overall goal of making a better product. Picking a subset of suggestions and expanding them beyond our expectations shows your initiative.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you feel the project ideas will take too much time as stated, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add that to your proposal</li>
<li>Include what you think a reasonable scope should be.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need your ideas to be completed on time with 100% test cases with each PR.</p>
<ol>
<li>Brittle code that breaks easily does not help the project</li>
<li>Incomplete functionality is not acceptable unless specifically stated.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are any dependencies on other project ideas, then state it. Also include additional or alternative things that you would do if the dependencies are not completed in your desired time frame</p>
<p>The project is so much in its infancy that we&#x27;ll accept any good idea that users will want or will facilitate that they could want. They must significantly advance our goal of having an MVP within the year.</p>
<p>We also welcome any other ideas that we could use. Please review the &quot;Desired Features&quot; section of this website for <strong>even more ideas</strong> and further necessary information.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="documentation">Documentation<a href="#documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Documentation" title="Direct link to Documentation">​</a></h3>
<p>We need to reduce the learning curve of contributors and sysadmins alike. Project work needs to be well documented in our code so that tools can eventually automatically add it to our documentation websites.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="testing">Testing<a href="#testing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testing" title="Direct link to Testing">​</a></h3>
<p>All code submitted must be tested. We are working towards getting to 100% test code coverage on all Talawa repositories. This will mean that you will have to write tests for new code you write or modify.</p>
<p>The test percent code coverage requirement will incrementally rise with each pull request. In some cases you may have to write a few extra tests for code you may not have updated. We hope this will be rare.</p>
<p>Write code that will work in the long term. Eliminate brittle code that will easily break.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="repository-languages-and-skills">Repository Languages and Skills<a href="#repository-languages-and-skills" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Repository Languages and Skills" title="Direct link to Repository Languages and Skills">​</a></h3>
<p>Here is a list of basic skills that will be required for each repository.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Talawa:</strong> Flutter / Dart, GraphQL</li>
<li><strong>Talawa-API:</strong> Typescript, GraphQL, MongoDB</li>
<li><strong>Talawa-Admin Portal:</strong> TypeScript</li>
</ol>
<p>There are others, but these are the primary ones that will guide your contributions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="impact-definition">Impact Definition<a href="#impact-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact Definition" title="Direct link to Impact Definition">​</a></h3>
<p>We have categorized the various ideas according to the degree of impact they will have to the project. Use these definitions to understand how each idea will affect our overall project goals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low-hanging fruit:</strong> These projects require minimal familiarity with the codebase and basic technical knowledge. They are relatively short, with clear goals.</li>
<li><strong>Risky/Exploratory:</strong> These projects push the scope boundaries of our development efforts. They might require expertise in an area not covered by our current development team. They might take advantage of a new technology. There is a reasonable chance that the project might be less successful, but the potential rewards make it worth the attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Fun/Peripheral:</strong> These projects might not be related to the current core development focus, but create new innovations and new perspective for our project.</li>
<li><strong>Core development:</strong> These projects derive from the ongoing work from the core of our development team. The list of features and bugs is never-ending, and help is always welcome.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Automation:</strong> These projects are the code that our organization uses to get our development work done; for example, projects that improve the automation of releases, regression tests and automated builds. This is a category in which a contributor can be really helpful, doing work that the development team has been putting off while they focus on core development.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="difficulty">Difficulty<a href="#difficulty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Difficulty" title="Direct link to Difficulty">​</a></h3>
<p>Most of our project ideas require knowledge of two or more programming languages. Meaningful PRs that prove your understanding of the repos will always be beneficial. We have created testing issues specifically for this purpose.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hard:</strong> Requires dominion of the language used by the repo most affected by the project. A good working knowledge of the languages used by other affected repositories will be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> A good working knowledge of the languages used by affected repositories will be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Easy:</strong> A beginner&#x27;s level knowledge of the languages is sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="research">Research<a href="#research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Research" title="Direct link to Research">​</a></h3>
<p>Talawa is a suite of applications that are aimed at managing the memberships of community based organizations. This concept may be new to you, and we suggest you research church, temple and/or synagogue management software as a starting point. Talawa needs to have a broader reach and your additions to our ideas will make the difference. We have included links to YouTube videos on this page that will be useful in improving your understanding.</p>
<p>Your solution should ideally consider the:</p>
<ol>
<li>ability of typical small community organizations with limited resources to:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>get tech support to maintain the application</li>
<li>have tech-savvy users</li>
<li>afford long term costs</li>
<li>need all membership information completely under their control</li>
<li>manage services outside the applications</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>impact of using third party services</li>
<li>performance / usability trade-offs</li>
<li>potential data residency law requirements</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> We need a better solution for handling files uploaded from Talawa clients. GraphQL is unsuitable for file access and, storing files in the code tree with only a <code>.gitignore</code> file as protection is risky.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Objects must be:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Stored in a location outside the code tree</li>
<li>Accessed using industry best practices and libraries that are unlikely to be deprecated or abandoned.</li>
<li>Deduplicated.</li>
<li>Encrypted whenever and wherever possible.</li>
<li>Stored in the same way independent of their size, type or other characteristics.</li>
<li>Screened for malicious content.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The Talawa apps are closely coupled with cloud services which creates operational concerns.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>This greatly complicates setup as each new service requires new externally controlled configuration parameters.</li>
<li>It also adds greater troubleshooting and billing complexity for organizations that will not be tech-savvy.</li>
<li>Small organizations may also find it difficult to comply with new data residency laws when using international services.<br>
<!-- -->For this idea there must be no dependency on any third party cloud service providers, all the code must run on the API server.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong>
<ol>
<li><em>Chat</em> : A key component of the Talawa application suite is chat. Though some endpoints have been created, the feature has not been fully activated and deployed. Chat must be:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Hosted on the API server. We expect the typical Talawa deployment to be small and hosted by communities with limited funding that may not be able to afford cloud additional services.</li>
<li>Available as 1 to 1 and 1 to many group chat options</li>
<li>Automatically available to registered attendees of events as a dedicated group chat instance.</li>
<li>Encrypted whenever and wherever possible</li>
<li>Capable of allowing users to reply to any historical comment.</li>
<li>Allow administrators to respond in various ways to complaints about chats.</li>
<li>Have the ability for older chats to be purged from the system</li>
<li>Assume that most communities using the chat system will be small. Research typical community sizes, seating and event attendance for various community based organizations in designing your solution. Consider easy to implement scalability if required.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Administrators will need features to improve the management of, and reporting on, event attendance. For this to be most effective, event attendance will need to be accessed from either from:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>A member&#x27;s profile (<em>Member Profile</em>) view.</li>
<li>An event&#x27;s detail page (<em>Event Detail</em>) views.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong> This project idea is more prescriptive than others in the list because we need to get the basic structure correct as it will have a long term impact on our repositories. There will be lots of ways for you transform this foundation into an impressive result.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><strong>Member Profile:</strong> We need additional functionality to the member profile screen to achieve this goal.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Attendance</em>: A button or menu item should be presented (Admins only) on each member&#x27;s profile. When selected, this should display an attendance view.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Attendance View:</em> This should display a list of events that the member has attended and any upcoming events the member is registered to attend.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>If the member has neither attended a past event nor is registered for an upcoming event options should be presented to the admin user to;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Invite the selected member to upcoming events.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the member has attended past events or is registered for upcoming events, display the following attributes for each event in the list.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Event Name:</em> The name of the event</li>
<li><em>Date of Event:</em> The scheduled start date for the event</li>
<li><em>Recurring Flag:</em> A flag indicating if the event ids a recurring event</li>
<li><em>Task Flag:</em> A flag indicating that the member has been assigned one or multiple tasks for the event</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The admin user must have the ability to toggle between a list of <em>past events</em> attended by the selected member and <em>upcoming events</em> they are registered for.</li>
<li>The admin user must have the ability to interact with the list of events being displayed. (S)he must be able to:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Search:</em> Search the displayed event list for an event by <em>event name</em>.</li>
<li><em>Sort:</em> Sort the displayed event list by <em>event name</em> or by <em>event date</em>.</li>
<li><em>Filter:</em> Filter the displayed event list by a date range based on <em>event date</em> or by one or multiple <em>event tags</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The admin user must be able to select an event in the list and navigate to the <em>event detail</em> view.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Event Detail</strong>
<ol>
<li><em>Event Attendance Management</em>: The user (Admins only) must be presented with a button or menu item for <em>Attendance</em>. When this item is selected the admin user must be navigated to a list of <em>attendees</em> to the selected event.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>For each item in the list of Attendees display the following attributes;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Member Name</em>: Name of registered member that attended the event</li>
<li><em>Member Status</em>: The status of the member in the organization</li>
<li><em>Number of Events Attended</em>: The number of events attended by the member;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>This month</li>
<li>This year</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the selected event is a <em>past event</em> or <em>future event</em>, display the list of attendees and/or invitees for the event where relevant.</li>
<li>Flag attendees that performed a role or was assigned to an Action Item for the event</li>
<li>If the event is part of a <em>recurring event</em>, the admin user must be presented with options to;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>View a list of past events in the series</li>
<li>Edit all events in the series</li>
<li>Edit the current event and future occurrences of the event</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Admin user must be able to <em>Check-In</em> a member to the event.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>If people turn up at the door, and they are not in the system, it must be possible to add them as part of the check-in process (USERS and NON_USERs alike).</li>
<li>Events requiring registration must only be able to check-in people who have registered. It must also be possible to add, register and check-in people at the door as an exception if the venue has the space.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Event Attendance Reporting</em>
<ol>
<li>Reporting and data visualization is also required for events. The following charts and measures must be displayed;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Total number attendees</em> for the event</li>
<li>For recurring events, historical attendance must be reported on;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li><em>Attendance Trend</em>; Charting<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>6 months</li>
<li>12 months</li>
<li>24 months</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Attendance Frequency</em>; the number of persons attending the selected event for the;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>First time</li>
<li>Second time</li>
<li>Third time</li>
<li>Fourth time</li>
<li>Greater than 5 times</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The admin should be able to view the list of attendees in each frequency bucket</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Attendance Demography</em>; the number of attendants grouped by;<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Member Status</li>
<li>Age Group</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Think of novel ways of tabulating historical attendance for recurring events</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> These are ongoing efforts in which API and Admin CRUD work has been happening for months. You will need to integrate these efforts into your project, and make improvements. We feel the other needs of this project will require a majority of your time.<!-- -->

<ol>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: We need a comprehensive user tag management system for Talawa Admin to address current limitations and enhance community organisation. This system will introduce both automatic and manual tag allotment, hierarchical tag structures, and CRUD operations.<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>The current lack of a robust tag management system hinders effective organisation and communication within the Talawa community. The proposed system aims to streamline user categorization, facilitating targeted communication and enhancing community engagement.</li>
<li>This should not be confused with hashtags or tagging someone in a chat. This is for applying a label/category to User and Event objects</li>
<li>Support for this feature was added to Talawa API in the past year. We welcome GitHub issues to verify and rectify the expected functionality of this API support during the GSoC evaluation period.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong>:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Automatic tag allotment based on predefined criteria.</li>
<li>Manual tag allotment by Admins and/or Super Admins.</li>
<li>Hierarchical tag structures with parent and nested sub-tags.</li>
<li>CRUD operations for tags (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</li>
<li>Grouping of users based on tags.</li>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> The oversight of an organization&#x27;s volunteer activities is an important part of an administrator&#x27;s role. These lightweight project management features will facilitate improved coordination within membership.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong>
<ol>
<li><em>Action Items</em> : We need a way to manage the assignment of tasks to Users. These may or may not be related to events. API support for this feature has already been implemented via this <a href="https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/issues/1595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talawa API issue</a>
<ol>
<li>The challenge will be in creating an intuitive web UI/UX to make this feature desirable. This would include screens for:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Sortable, editable tabular lists of action items assigned <code>to me</code> and <code>by me</code> showing the most important summary fields in the database schema.</li>
<li>CRUD activities for action items</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The management of Action Items related to events must be intuitive too, possibly with the creative use of filters.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Event Agendas</em> : Community based organizations will often need to have agendas for their events. Reasons for this requirement would include:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>The order of ceremony for a wedding</li>
<li>Agendas for committee meetings
We need the ability to make events have agendas.API support for this feature has already been implemented via this <a href="https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/issues/1588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talawa API issue</a>. Desirable features include:</li>
<li>Functional CRUD screens for event agendas</li>
<li>When the first section is created, all existing agenda items must be tied to it while maintaining the agenda item order.</li>
<li>Changing the sequencing of an agenda section must not alter the sequencing of the agenda items within each section.</li>
<li>Changing the sequencing of agenda items must not alter:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>The sequencing of sections</li>
<li>The sequencing of any other sections should other sections exist
The challenge will be in creating an intuitive UI/UX to make this feature desirable with drag and drop capabilities where applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em>Volunteer Management</em> : Community based organizations will often need assistance for their events. We need the ability to manage volunteers.

Desirable features include:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Functional CRUD screens for event volunteer group management, including inviting or assigning users to serve up to defined limits.</li>
<li>Tracking responses to volunteer, easily viewing volunteer  profiles</li>
<li>With recurring events a volunteer may not be available for every time, maybe every other time. The app will need to  remember this availability and automatically assign them on the relevant days.</li>
