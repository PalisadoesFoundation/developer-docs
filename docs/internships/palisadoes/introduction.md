title: Our Internships
---

This is an opportunity to work with our organization external to our other sponsored internships.

## Intern at The Palisadoes Foundation

As an intern, you will work closely with volunteers in your area of interest, such as:

1. UX/UI design
1. Software development
1. Technical writing.

All applicants must be:

1. open-minded and tolerant of others,
1. able to work as part of a team, and
1. interested in supporting our computing projects that make communities thrive.

Our volunteers are dispersed globally, so all internships will be remote.

## Funding

These internships may be paid or volunteer based on our available funds.

1. We will provide any appropriate documentation you might need to receive funding and school credit from outside sources. 
1. We place an emphasis on providing educational opportunities for interns in which they work closely with our volunteer mentors. [Take a look at our past interns](https://www.palisadoes.org).

## Focus Areas

We are especially interested in adding features to our software that makes it:

1. More intuitive to use
1. Reliable
1. Very clearly documented

## Schedule

We prefer internships during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. 

1. For unpaid internships we prefer twelve-week terms where there is flexibility with start and end dates as necessary. This is negotiable.
1. With paid internships we try to sponsor 350 hours of work at rates similar to those of the Google Summer of Code. This ideal depends on our levels of funding.

Work during the term can be either full-time (40 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours per week) positions. We will prefer candidates that are able to work full time, particularly during the summer term.

## How to Apply

Send us the following:

1. A letter of interest
1. A project proposal using our [internship application template](../introduction/application-template.md)
1. A resume with two references
