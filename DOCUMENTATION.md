## General Developer Documentation

1. Our [developer.palisadoes.org](https://developer.palisadoes.org/) contains our general developer documentation.
1. This repository contains the markdown files for the site.
1. The site and this repo use Docusaurus to render documentation markdown files into static HTML.

## Editing files

The process in easy:

2. Follow the instructions in the `INSTALLATION.md` file to launch the repo's Docusaurus website on your machine.
3. Edit the appropriate markdown files in the `docs/` directory
4. If adding a file, then you may need to edit the `sidebars.js` which is used to generate the left navigation menus. In most cases placing a new file in a directory is sufficient.
5. Edited files are viewable in the test Docusaurus website.
6. Always monitor the local website in your brower to make sure the changes are acceptable.
   - You'll be able to see errors that you can use for troubleshooting in the CLI window you used to launch the local website.
